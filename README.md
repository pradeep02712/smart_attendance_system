Smart Attendance System Using Facial Recognition
üìñ Project Overview
The Smart Attendance System automates attendance marking using Facial Recognition. Students' faces are detected from uploaded images, and attendance is recorded in Excel and PDF formats. This system reduces manual errors and saves time.

Key Features
Automatic attendance marking from images.
Face recognition using Facenet (MTCNN + InceptionResnetV1).
Attendance records saved in Excel and downloadable as PDF.
Streamlit web interface for easy interaction.
Temporary image handling and training of new models.
